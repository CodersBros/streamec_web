      'Fitness24Seven showed interest in starting using Set4Play for their group fitness business. But there were a few components in the Set4Play music mixing tool that needed to be improved, among them sound effects that were used for supporting both instructors and class participants. Set4Play development team and Fitness24Seven group fitness staff jointly produced a requirement specification. The Set4Play team made the decided improvements and after a pilot run the new version was approved. Now all Fitness24Seven instructors use Set4Play and the teams regularly meet to discuss product improvements.',
